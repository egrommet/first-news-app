          <td>Cesar Aguilar, an 18-year-old Latino, was shot and killed Thursday, April 30, 1992, in Westlake. Aguilar, a Honduran immigrant, was arrested with more than 40 other alleged looters near Sam&#39;s Corner Liquor Store at 6th Street and Westlake Avenue. Officers say he was ordered to lie prone, and that he then pulled what appeared to be a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward them. Officers fired at Aguilar with a 9-millimeter pistol and a shotgun. He was struck in the chest and died at the scene, according to an initial coroner&#39;s account. The &quot;gun,&quot; however, was a plastic toy with a black barrel and brown grips, officials said. Aguilar had lived for five months in the Park View Luxury Apartments, a $450-a-month hotel at MacArthur Park. Friends said he delivered newspapers for a living. A father of two, Aguilar had planned to return to Honduras to be reunited with his pregnant girlfriend. Aguilar&#39;s body was flown back to Honduras at that government&#39;s expense because Aguilar&#39;s family could not pay the $1,976, Consul General Rene Francisco Umana said. &quot;It&#39;s so sad,&quot; Umana said. &quot;Maybe he didn&#39;t have an idea to hurt anybody . . . but the situation was so difficult, so grave. In L.A., things can happen.&quot;</td>

Andrew, who worked odd jobs in construction, went out Thursday night and never returned. After trying in vain to locate her son, Gloria Andrew filed a missing-persons report six days later. The next day, a Compton police officer knocked on her door to tell her the news. Andrew was seen running from a nearby shoe store with other looters, police said, and was carrying boxes of shoes and a large bottle of beer. Andrew had dropped the shoes and was waving the bottle when a Compton police officer caught up with him in an alley and shot him once in the face as they grappled, police said. Andrew, the father of two 14-year-old girls, had had minor run-ins with police, his mother said, and once served six months in the California Youth Authority on an assault conviction. But she said it was &quot;inconceivable&quot; that he would strike an armed officer. &quot;He wasn&#39;t that type of person.&quot;</td>

According to authorities, Benavidez was shot after fleeing from a gas station he had tried to rob at Western and Vernon avenues. Benavidez pointed a shotgun at officers after being ordered to drop it, they said. Two LAPD Metro Division officers fired 10 rounds, investigators said. A second suspect, Victor Munoz, 19, was struck in the stomach, police said, after he appeared to arm himself with a handgun. Munoz, who was hospitalized for two weeks, was not arrested. Investigators later determined that Munoz was carrying a beer can. Munoz said Benavidez did not have a gun and did not try to rob the gas station. J.C. Wilburn, who operates the Shell station, said two Latino men -- one with a shotgun -- tried to rob his business moments before the shooting, but left when he and two co-workers displayed guns of their own. Almost immediately after the would-be robbers turned the corner, Wilburn said, gunfire rang out. Benavidez, who moved to the United States in 1985, was born in El Salvador and had served in the Salvadoran Army. In Los Angeles, he repaired cars and delivered telephone books.</td>

          <td>Mark Garcia, a 15-year-old Latino youth, was shot and killed Thursday, April 30, 1992, in Lennox. Friends said he was drawn by curiosity to the looting and fires in a mini-mall at Hawthorne Boulevard and 101st Street but did not participate. An initial Sheriff&#39;s Department report alleged that Mark was one of four jewelry shop looters who fled in a black Ford Tempo and engaged in a shootout with Deputies Wayne Beckley and Jeffrey Moore. The suspected looters bailed out of their car six blocks away. Deputies caught up with them in a nearby parking lot and returned fire, killing Mark. The boy turned out to be unarmed. Witnesses, including two youths in the Tempo, have told The Times that Mark had not been in the car with them. Sheriff&#39;s investigators later confirmed that Mark was already at the parking lot when the looting suspects arrived and was shot while fleeing with them from deputies.</td>

Instead they were found guilty of assault with a deadly weapon and conspiring to assault, loot and rob. The jury said the three weren&#39;t guilty of murder because &quot;there wasn&#39;t evidence proving that the three defendants actually did shoot the victim,&quot; the forewoman said at the time. Williams and Nixon were sentenced to nearly six years in prison and ordered to pay restitution. Jones, who was a minor at the time, was sentenced to five years and eight months in the California Youth Authority and ordered to pay $5,000 to a crime victims&#39; restitution fund.</td>

He was taken to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, where he died. Less than four hours after truck driver Reginald O. Denny and others were attacked at Florence and Normandie, four LAPD officers in a patrol car said they came under intense fire from looters outside a Korean American-owned store in Green Meadows at Central Avenue and 112th Street. The officers returned fire and then sped off to await reinforcements. One of seven rounds they fired had hit a heavyset, shirtless gunman. When they returned, the victim and his weapon had vanished. LAPD officials later learned that 17-year-old Harrison had died of a gunshot wound at the hospital, and ballistics tests showed that he had been struck by a 9-millimeter bullet fired by an LAPD officer. Harrison was angry over the verdicts in the King beating case, relatives said, and had helped loot clothing stores earlier in the night. But whether he was the shirtless suspect who shot at police is another question. About 10:30 p.m., there was a soft knock on the door of an apartment Harrison&#39;s girlfriend shared with her mother, Myra Collins. It was Harrison, Collins said later, and he was wearing a blood-drenched T-shirt with a small bullet hole in the chest. &quot;It was just like when you watch these westerns and they stagger in the door,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&#39;t know what DeAndre was doing,&quot; Collins said. &quot;I don&#39;t know if he was an angel or a devil. But he did have on a white T-shirt.&quot; &quot;He was just a kid that got caught up in a vicious cycle,&quot; said Verbum Dei High School Principal Robert Mendoza, who had known Harrison for years. &quot;It&#39;s very difficult to live around here.&quot;</td>

O&#39;Dell Whitley Jr., 19, and Leonard Hampton, 18, were sentenced in Pasadena Superior Court for commercial burglary of an Arcadia sporting goods store and attempted robbery of a pedestrian. The two originally were charged with a series of crimes that included the stabbing of Maronian. In April 1993, Whitley and Hampton were found guilty of the lesser crimes. But a mistrial was declared on the murder charge when only four of the 12 jurors voted for conviction. The district attorney decided not to retry the two for murder.</td>

          <td>Howard Eugene Martin, a 22-year-old black man, was shot and killed Sunday, May 3, 1992, near the intersection of North Los Robles Avenue and Claremont Street in Pasadena. He was known as &quot;Nine Lives.&quot; Twice in the last five years, Martin had been a passenger in cars where the driver was killed. Once, it was a late-night automobile crash. The other time a friend was shot in the head by masked gunmen. &quot;The boy just fell into Howard&#39;s lap,&quot; recalls his sister, Wanda. Martin&#39;s luck finally ran out three days after the verdicts in the King beating case. The father of three, who grew up only a couple of blocks from King, was killed by a stray bullet. The incident began, police said, when two officers tried to disperse more than 150 party-goers at a Pasadena apartment complex but were greeted with rocks and bottles -- and gunshots. Nearly 25 more officers arrived quickly, and 10 of them fired a total of 70 rounds at several assailants. Martin, relatives said, was visiting friends at a nearby apartment when he stepped onto a balcony to look at what was going on. He was struck in the head by a police bullet that apparently ricocheted off the street, police said. Martin&#39;s sister and other relatives said police should have shown more control over their gunfire. &quot;They probably felt they were under attack,&quot; she said. &quot;But that doesn&#39;t justify firing 70 rounds.&quot;</td>

Rosemary Sanchez. A suspect was arrested in the Miller slaying, but the district attorney&#39;s office decided that the witness&#39; identification was too shaky.</td>

Near Florence Avenue and the 110 Freeway, Orebo tried to make a lane change, nearly cutting off a car behind him. The other driver honked and pulled alongside at a stoplight. Williams drew a handgun, loaded it and pointed it past Orebo toward the other driver, an LAPD officer who was out of uniform and en route to work. &quot;The guy looked at us,&quot; Webb said,&quot;and he jumped like he was in shock. Then he pulled up his gun. . . . Then he shot like three times and hit Sticks.&quot; Orebo, mortally wounded, punched the accelerator. The car lurched into a wall and caught fire. Orebo, a dropout and the father of a 4-year-old son, had planned to get married the next month and become an auto mechanic, said his mother, Georgia Alfred. He had been jailed a couple of times for traffic tickets and other small offenses, she said. &quot;But nothing violent. No guns or anything like that.&quot; Alfred said her son and Williams watched the verdicts in the King beating case together and were angry,&quot;but he wasn&#39;t going out beating anyone or carrying a gun.&quot; &quot;From what I gathered, my son didn&#39;t know [Williams] had the gun until he pulled it up,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m angry, but I&#39;m angry with the young man.&quot;</td>

A street evangelist, Tope went to a shopping mall at the corner of Western Avenue and Sunset Boulevard, where hundreds of people had gathered to watch looters ransack a Sav-On drugstore. There he began to preach, urging the crowd to stop the looting and place their faith in Jesus. As he was preaching, two men began to beat him. When he tried to flee, he fell to the ground, and the men kicked him repeatedly in the head for nearly three minutes, witnesses said. Tope was rescued by a passing ambulance, but he lapsed into a coma shortly after arriving at the hospital. Two men charged with murder in the last major case of the Los Angeles riots each pleaded no contest in the fatal beating of Tope and were sentenced to prison May 9, 1994. Fidel Ortiz, 22, and Leonard Sosa, 24, both former warehouse workers for a Dodger Stadium concessionaire, entered the pleas to reduced charges of voluntary manslaughter on the same day they were to go on trial for the April 30, 1992, attack. Under a plea agreement, the judge in the case sentenced Ortiz to an 11-year prison term and Sosa to a six-year term.</td>

At Watson&#39;s funeral, 600 people, many of them teenagers, filled the church to capacity. The service began quietly, with testimony from friends and relatives. Then the grief and tension seemed to escalate to a point where the church was filled with the sound of weeping and wailing.</td>

The crew members had stayed up that night watching riot coverage on television. Around 10:45 p.m., they heard the sound of cars colliding outside the motel -- the conclusion of a chase in which, according to police, three people in one car pursued two robbery suspects in another. The crash brought many of the motel guests out onto the street. Willers stayed outside until the injured motorists were taken away by ambulance. According to co-workers, he returned to his room but decided to go back out half an hour later. Shots rang out, and he was found dead in the middle of the street. &quot;He was caught up in the moment when the city was erupting,&quot; said Det. Woodrow Parks of the LAPD&#39;s Foothill Division. &quot;It probably was a riot-related thing.&quot;</td>
